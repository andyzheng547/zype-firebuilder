## Fire App Builder

Fire App Builder is a java framework that allows developers to quickly build immersive, java based Android media applications for Fire TV, without writing code.  Fire App Builder accomplishes this by using a plug and play java framework with easy configuration files.  Developers simply specify the format of their media feed in a json file and add resources for logos and colors to create a rich media TV experience quickly.  Fire App Builder supports multiple modules for Analytics, Authentication and Advertising that you can enable for your app.

Full Documentation for Fire App Builder is located [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/fire-app-builder-overview).

## Creating Custom App Based on the Template<a name="template"></a>

1. Select `templateDebug` (or `templateRelease`) build variant for `app` and `ZypeAPI` modules

2. Set `templateRelease` value to `defaultPublishConfig` parameters in `PurchaseInterface/build.gradle` and `Application/ZypeAPI/build.gradle` files.

3. Replace following placeholders with actual values:

  **Application/ZypeAPI/src/template/java/com/zype/fire/api/ZypeSettings.java**
  - ```<APP_KEY>```
  - ```<CLIENT_ID>```
  - ```<ROOT_PLAYLIST_ID>```

Also replace features and monetization options placeholders with `true` or `false` values.

**Application/app/build.gradle**
- ```<APPLICATION_ID>``` - used to identify your app on the device and in the marketplace. Must be unique and usually is following `com.yourdomain.aftv` pattern.

**Application/app/src/template/res/values/strings.xml**
- ```<APP_NAME>```
- ```<APP_NAME_SHORT>```

**Application/app/src/template/res/values-en/strings.xml**
- ```<APP_NAME>```

**Application/app/src/template/res/values/custom.xml**
- ```<BRAND_COLOR>``` - hex color used for highlighting buttons and widgets

4. Update following resources:

**Company logo**

*Application/app/src/template/res/drawable/logo_company.png*

Image dimensions should be approximately 356 x 108 px and have a transparent background.

**App icon**

- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png*

You can use icon generator in Android Studio to produce icons with required dimensions from 512x512 source icon image.

5. Setup UI options

**Left menu**

Left menu will appear when the user press `Menu` button on the device retomte control. It contains the same actions like Settings row at the bottom of the main screen.
This option is turned off by default. To turn it on make the method `displayLeftMenu()` in the `ZypeConfiguration.java` return `true` value.

**Watched bar**

The watched bar is displayed on the video thumbnail and shows the time that user watched this video.
This option is turned on by default. To turn it off make the method `displayWatchedBarOnVideoThumbnails()` in the `ZypeConfiguration.java` return `false` value.
